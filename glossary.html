    <ol class='blankol'>
        <li>0 matrix = A matrix of 0â€™s, (all elements = 0).</li>
        <li>2x2 = A square matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns, often used for modelling system in x and y coordinates only.</li>
        <li>3x3 = A square matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns, often used for modelling a 3 dimensional system, x, y and z.</li>
        <li>Associative = This is a property of matrices that means (AxB)xC=Ax(BxC).</li>
        <li>Column = A set of numbers in a given vertical of a matrix make up a column.</li>
        <li>Determinant = Often denoted det(A) or |A|, this is the volume scaling factor for the transformation represented.</li>
        <li>Eigenvector = These are vectors that remain unchanged by a given transformation.</li>
        <li>Eigenvalue = This is the associated scaling factor for the eigenvector.</li>
        <li>Element = An element is the individual entry in the matrix, any one value.</li>
        <li>Enlargement = With its dimensions unchanged by a transformation, a shapes area is increased by a scale factor.</li>
        <li>Identity = This is any sqaure matrix (most commonly 2x2 and 3x3) with its leading diagonals elements having value of 1, all other elements being 0.</li>
        <li>Invariant = When a point or set of points undergoes a transformation, an invariant point is one that does not change its position. A line of invariant points is formed by a lien of points which do not move as a result of being on the line of reflection. An invariant line is one that connects the transformed point on a shape to its original coordinate. </li>
        <li>Matrix = A matrix is rectangular array of values or collection of column vectors that allows for simple data manipulation and modelling of geometric operations. </li>
        <li>Plane(s) = A plane is a 2 dimensional surface, often applied to describing the combination of two of the coordinated axis</li>
        <li>Row = A set of numbers in a given horizontal of a matrix make up a row.</li>
        <li>Shear = If a non-zero value replaces a zero valued element in the identity matrix, then the shape will stretch uniaxial.</li>
        <li>Stretch = A shapes dimension will be altered with a stretch, one direction of increase occurring, movement relative to a point or line of origin.</li>
        <li>Subscript = The positon of an element in a matrix can be described with subscript notation. The shape of a matrix is described by m x n, it having m rows and n columns, so an element can be described a<sub>ij</sub>, I and j being the respective row and column for a given element.</li>
        <li>Transformation = This refers to the movement and translation of objects or a set of coordinates in the coordinate plane.</li>
        <li>Transpose = The transpose of a matrix creates a new one for which the rows are the columns of the original. Denoted by AT.</li>
        <li>Vector = A series of numbers in a row or column that describe the displacement of a point, a direction or acceleration. (Commonly values ordered relative to x then y then z (if applicable)). </li>
